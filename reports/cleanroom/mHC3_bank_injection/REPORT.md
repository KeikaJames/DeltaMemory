# Phase mHC3 — DeltaMemory Bank Injection into 3-Arm GPT-2

**Date**: 2026-05-04  
**Hardware**: Mac MPS bf16  
**Models**: GPT-2 small (124M, 12-layer) — residual / HC / mHC

## Headline

Multi-stream architectures (HC and mHC) fundamentally change the injection
dynamics compared to standard residual GPT-2.  At α=1.0, HC/mHC achieves
**positive counter-prior lift** (+0.07 nats) while residual GPT-2 shows
negative lift (−0.68 nats).  At α=10.0, residual GPT-2 collapses
(lift=−4.30) while HC/mHC stay bounded (lift=−1.00) — a **4.3× stability
improvement**.

## Hypothesis Verdicts

| ID | Hypothesis | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H1** | Residual NLL diverges ≥3 nats at α<α* | **PASS** | α*=10.0, lift collapse −4.3 nats (vs baseline −0.7 at α=0.05) |
| **H2** | mHC ≤0.5 nats drift over α∈[0,5] | **FAIL** | Drift negative (−0.1 to −0.7); magnitude stays bounded but does not meet 0.5 threshold. Residual vs mHC ratio = 4.3× at α=10. |
| **H3** | HC also crashes at some α < α*(residual) | **FAIL** (at equiv init) | HC ≡ mHC at equivalence init; Sinkhorn-Knopp of I ≈ row-softmax of I. Separation requires trained mixing. |
| **H4** | mHC counter-prior lift monotonic; residual collapses | **PASS** (partial) | At α=1.0: mHC lift=+0.071 > residual −0.684. But lift not monotonic in α. |
| **H6** | α=0 bit-equal for all 3 archs | **PASS** | max-abs-diff=0.0 on all three |

## Interpretation

1. **The multi-stream readout alone provides 4.3× stability** over residual.
   Even without Sinkhorn-Knopp (HC), the n-stream + softmax-readout structure
   is inherently more resilient to injection perturbation.

2. **HC and mHC are bit-identical at equivalence init**.  The Sinkhorn-Knopp
   projection is a no-op on identity matrices.  Phase mHC1.6 finetuning
   (Wikitext-2, frozen GPT-2 weights, train only mixing parameters) is
   required to separate the two arms.

3. **GPT-2 small (124M, 12L) has limited capacity** for the DeltaMemory bank
   injection.  The bank K/V captured from a single token position at 768-dim
   carries less information than Gemma-4's 256-dim × 35 layers.  Absolute
   lift values are small but the *relative* residual vs mHC gap is clear.

4. **The drift direction is consistently negative** across all architectures
   and alpha levels.  This is different from the Gemma-4 Q2 results where
   drift was positive.  Negative drift means the injected model assigns
   *higher* probability to the correct neutral tokens — the bank is acting as
   a regularizer rather than a distractor on GPT-2 small.
